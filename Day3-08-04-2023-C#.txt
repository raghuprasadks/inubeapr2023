Recap:

Inheritance,polymorphism,abstraction



1.Write a predicate delegate
to check whether a person is eligible 
to vote or not

input age
boolean 

a. Write IsEligibleToVote(int age)
function

c. Write lambda expression
Encapsulation
Collections
Generic,Non-Generic
ArrayList
List



a. Create DelegateAssignment Class
with a static method
ExectuteDelegate
and write the logic of delegate execution
in this

b. Create a Calculator class
having following methods

internal static int Add(int n1,int n2)
internal static int Subtract(int n1,int n2)
internal static int Multiply(int n1,int n2)

Write a delegate to execute above functions

Generic delegate


Assignment

1. Create UniversalAccount class
having following attributes
actno,name,bank,branch,balance

a. Create a constructor with above attributes
b. Create Deposit(int actno,int amttodeposit)
increase the balance by amttodeposit
This should return the balance
c. Create Withdraw(int actno,int amttowithdraw)
decrease the balance by amttowithdraw
throw Insufficient balance exception
incase the amttowithdraw is greater than
the balance
This should return the balance

2. Create UniversalBankTest class

a. Create ManageAccount() method
